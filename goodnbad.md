# The Good & Bad

### 1. Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly.  Why do you think it didn't go well?What would you do (have you done) to make it better?

At this time, I cannot recall a time that I taught a CS lesson poorly, however, I do recall a time when I was not confident in cognitive understanding for the lesson I was teaching. Being new to the CS world, I took my time to understand the lesson that I was going to teach. However, after listening to the recording, I had realized that I was so excited to teach the newly comprehensive concept that I spoke at a very fast pace.If I felt it was fast for me - one that had understood the material - I know that it would have been challenging for my students to grasp due to speed. To modify for the better, I began recording the next few lessons. Being mindful of the tape and the purpose, I spoke at a slower pace without compromising my excitement to teach. Prior to the recordings, I had not known that I spoke fast while I taught lessons in school. This was a wonderful blessing for myself and students. 


### 2. Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went really well. Why do you think it went so well?
 
My class was assigned to create an extensive  CS unit plan. During the research of this lesson, I began to make greater connections in understanding myself. After turning in the project, I began to teach the unit. The lessons were well thought out, the lesson plans were helpful for time management, and since the unit plan was recently created, the lessons were fresh. As I taught the lessons, one major success was modifying the lessons as I went along. It was very exciting to edit the unit that I had spent time creating. It felt as if I was creating a second edition book and was fully invested in using the day-to-day teaching experience to allow me to complete an effective CS unit plan.
