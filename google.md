# Google Search for Plagerism: 
### Students will be able to create abstract or inspirational art using shapes in javascript (P5-JS). 

#### Task: 
Using the knowledge gained from lessons 1-5, students will:

1. Complete a graphic organizer. The graphic organizer asks students to

     - recreate art using a mentor/inspirational art or abstract art.
     - Identify the mathematical graph quadrants needed to create art.
     - Identify the shapes and formulas needed to create the art.
     - Identify the colors desired to create the art.

#### Top Three Search Results:

[P5-JS Artwork Inspiration (code)](https://editor.p5js.org/Sylvesterd2/sketches/B1kLLJ82b)
[Complex Artwork Inspiration (no code)](https://dribbble.com/search/p5js)
[When "Abstract Coded p5-JS Art" is wrtten in Google Serached. The results are complex animated CODE. However, animation is not the task.(https://editor.p5js.org/ri1/sketches/gF5dWrxd)


### Was the google search useful to identify plagerism:
  
The google search rendered results that were aligned to the task but not as simple as the sixth grade output (end result). If students were to copy and paste the P5-JS code into our assignment, it would easily be recognized as plagerism because of the complex code the google search rendered. Students in this program are only required to input simple shapes and colors (and mouse drag). This specific form of plagerism occured amonCancel changesg three students in my class last semester! Discussions took place after the plagerism and students were given the opportunity to rectify the situation.

### Was your search too simple/complex? Was "it" uncessarily complicated? 
Although the google search included copy/pastable code, the task was too simple to plagerize identifically (or "word for word"). All results were complex and did not match students the novice level of understanding. The plagerism results were very easily considered as google search results from the internet. This made identifying plagerism very easy. 

### What did you/can students learn from a plagerism experience?
As a teacher, I learned that empowering students to be lifelong learners challenges them to make positive decidisons that help themselves. I want students to be very reflective in their thinking and decision making. When given the opprotunity to talk plagerism, I will do so on a case-by-case basis or at the beginning of the year/unit. I believe addressing it continually can provide ideas and temptation that are uncessary. Rather than making general annoucmentments, I am reminded to be strategic by including in my project rubrics. 

 I believe students could learn from this plagerism experience. While plagerizing is not a good practice, in this code scenario, students who did attempt to plagerize last semester did practice reading code! :)
