# Grading Schema: Turtle Operation Task

## Task: 
Students are given a project with two parts.The first task is: 

 1. ) Write the function square which will instruct a turtle to draw a square with a specified side length. This should not be recursive. 

 To accomplish this goal, students must: 
- Write a function
- Test it. 
- Display code

 2. ) Write a RECURSIVE funtion that draws a straight line. "Spiral given a turtle and the length of the. initial side." (instruction copied and pasted from prewritten task from teacher -- this part is unclear)


 To accomplish this goal, students must: 
- Recursive function
- Test it.
- Window creation
- Display code



### Grading Task: 
Students will be graded on the completion of two assignments. The two completed assignments equate to the Turtle Function Project. Each assignment’s requirement is the same. The average of both assignments will be the student's final grade.

### Overal Grade: 
The overall grade for this activity will be the average of two 4-point grades (one for assignment one and assignment two) using a 4-point rubric. To achieve this grade students must submit:
soft (with re-admission)
hard submission (final)


### Soft Submission/Resubmission: 
##### Soft Submission:
Students are given the opportunity to turn in portions of their work on specific days prior to the due date. This allows for feedback and opportunities for #2 “Resubmission.” For this submission, students' grades will be reflected using a visual aid ... on a race track. There position on the race track will display how close they are to achieving the goal of the assignment.

##### Resubmission: 
Students are given ample time for this project. Therefore, they are implored to use the soft submission throughout the two weeks to resubmit as many times as they would like to prior to the due date. There are no opportunities to resubmit after the due date.


### Soft Submission: 

Great strides/effort in testing: 
- 0-2 command successfully ( L1 on race track)

- 3-4 command successfully(L2 on race track)

- 5-6 command successfully (L3 on race track)

- all command successfully (L4 on race track)

### Hard Submission: 
- 0 command tested successfully (pts = L1)
- 1-2 command tested successfully (pts = L2)
- 3-4 command tested successfully (pts = L3)
- 5-6 command tested successfully (pts = L4)
- all command tested successfully (5 bonus points -

*students will not receive 100pts (L4) for getting all correct*


 


### Rational
Providing students with the opportunity for soft submission grading helps students to not feel the pressure of points for learning and instead strides for effort. Students receive strides on a race track image to depict how close they are to successfully understanding and executing this task. This image provides more encouragement than simply a numerical grade for the number of correctly answered questions. Towards the end of the project, students will use the knowledge they have gained from feedback within their soft submissions to revise and turn in a more confident work (hard submission). This submission will result in a numerical grade.
