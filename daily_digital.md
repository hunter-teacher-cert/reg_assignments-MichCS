## Summary
This article focuses on bringing awareness to how harmful social media communication platforms for teens/young adults must still be monitored, analyzed, and modified. Particularly mentioned, the recently created social media app Discord, is under more severe watch and review as one of its members, a teenager, engaged in ongoing private conversations with an adult - a man well in his years - who asked for pictures and full descriptions of the teen’s home, bus, body, to name a few. After discovering this virtual encounter, the mother put a halt to the conversation, blocked and reported the user to the company. Since then, other parents, including the president of the United States, Joe Biden, have come forward and are all in agreement to implore necessary and immediate changes to protect the youth. In fact, during President Biden’s first union state address, he “urged lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.  Lawmakers are actively creating a bipartisan bill to put these changes in effect. Overall, this article is not only vital news to share and to be aware of as a teacher but important to discuss with the students we encounter. Students must be aware of the positive and negative intentions. We must not only protect them by keeping them safe but we must make them aware that there are many people who target youth for harmful reasons. 


### How can this be implemented in the classroom? 
Due to the nature of this topic, students may not feel courageous enough to share encounters they may have had on Discord. As a result, I would have students answer the following questions anonymously (in a “fishbowl”) and then in our discussion, read aloud the responses.
