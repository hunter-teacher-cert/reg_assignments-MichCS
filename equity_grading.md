### Do you agree with the general sentiment or not? Do you have specific points of agreement/disagreement? 

In general, I do agree with many statements that were shared in this new perspective of grading. It is true, as teachers, we have:
 There has been a lack of methodology for grading. We are truly taught to focus on how to effectively grade
We have not considered that this grading technique was created for a specific focus group in the industrial time in our lives.
Many disparities have been created because of the aforementioned (second point)
Many of the practices that we do as teachers have not had the opportunity to think differently about the subject. 
We teach students to equate learning with points - achieving one more, and scrambling for points for example. 
It is very helpful to both teachers, students and a new way of thinking to project what mastery looks like versus what points for a grade looks like. This allows students to transcend point language and have more discussions in the vocabulary of the content area. 
Teachers should stop creating and supporting the idea that we create structures that give them points for doing the preliminary work/practice and re-practice the idea that we should create structures and come up with ways to help students internalize the understanding that the preparation is preparation and pays-off on the summative performance. 
### For those of you currently teaching: Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so? 

I look forward to implementing many of the new ways of thinking into my beliefs and classroom. It is imperative that we evolve as teachers and break the mundane and monotonous ways of teaching and expectations for learning. Students will be better adults if we teach them to think differently. The grading policy is another way to help our students become lifelong learners and doers of thinking methodically, strategically and purposefully.
