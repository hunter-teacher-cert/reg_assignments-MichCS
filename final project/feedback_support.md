# Lesson Idea Feedback 

**Group's Topic:** Data Structure

**Guided Lesson Plan Suggestion:** Variables

**_Data Structure_** is such a complex unit for middle schoolers, especially 6th graders to grasp, that the first concept to support their growth in understanding of Data Structure is to teach the basic and required concept of data structure... which is is _variables._ It was suggested that I teach variables and use interactive hands-on unplugged activity for students to visualize variables which will allow students to secure a strong foundational understanding of data structures. 

**_In a follow-up feedback conversation,_** it was suggested that unplugged activities for whole class and group work would help students understand the concept of variables.
